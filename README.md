MakeMeLight - Arduino Ambient lighting
===========

This is a simple setup connecting 32 RGB LED's with one WS2801 per LED to the SPI interface on arduino.
There is two modes selectable in software.. 
- Display Mode: Which stretches the outer pixels on the screen to the LED's.. 
- Sound Mode: Which acts as a VU-meter for the sound coming out of the PC.. The left hand-side of the screen will represent the left speaker and the right hand-side will represent the right speaker..
